Whether you’re peering into an ocean, lake, river, or other body of water, you’re bound to find an array of beautiful and diverse aquatic animals. From coral reefs to mucky, slow-moving rivers, these animals in these environments couldn’t be more diverse or amazing.

Your first stop for aquatic animals is Kipp Aquarium. Underwater environments there recreate exotic places like the ocean reefs of Australia and local environments of the Texas coast. Natural Encounters has several aquatic tanks, housing an ocean reef, jellies, four-eyed fish and a large tank full of piranha with a tunnel kids (and adventurous adults!) can crawl through. Don’t miss our beautiful outdoor aquatic environment at the reflection pond, with its many koi fish.</p></th>

Sea turtles range in size from less than 100 pounds (50kg) and 2.5 feet (74.6cm) long (Kemp’s Ridley sea turtle) to up to 2,000 pounds and 8.5 feet (256cm). Sea turtles on exhibit in Kipp Aquarium are rescue turtles being rehabilitated for future return to their home, the Gulf of Mexico.
